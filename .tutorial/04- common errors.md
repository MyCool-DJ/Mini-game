`exit` is a function and needs `()`. The moment you add the `()` you notice the color change of `exit` from white to yellow.


```python
while True:
  print("You are in a coridoor, do you go left or right?")
  direction = input("> ")
  if direction == "left":
    print("You have fallen to your death")
    break
  elif direction == "right":
    continue
  else:
    print("Ahh! You're a genius, you've won")
    exit ()
print("The game is over, you've failed!")
```

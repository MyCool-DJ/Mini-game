# ðŸ‘‰ Day 17 Challenge

**Go find your Rock, Paper, Scissors game from Day 14 and add the code here before you start. We are going to build upon this game.** 


1. Use a loop to repeat the game multiple rounds.
2. Keep score of player 1 and player 2.
3. End the game when a player wins three rounds using `break` and `exit`.
4. Use `continue` to restart the round until one player wins three rounds.
5. Your last bit of code should be the results of which player won.


<details> <summary>ðŸ’¡ Hints</summary>

- Create a counting system using a variable and `+=` to keep track of the winner for each round.
- The `while` loop needs to be at the start of the game.
- Make sure you include `print` statements saying each player's final score at the end.
- Create an `if` statement to end the loop.
